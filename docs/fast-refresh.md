# Fast Refresh

Flareact _kind of_ supports React Fast Refresh. Next.js has a [nice explainer on Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh) and how it works.

However, you might find quirks with Flareact's implementation. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/flareact/flareact/issues) if you notice something strange.
